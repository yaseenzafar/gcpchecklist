### Project and Network Setup Checklist

### General Preparation
- [ ] **Assessment**
  - [ ] Review current architecture and resources on Azure for each project.
  - [ ] Identify dependencies and interconnections between services.
  - [ ] Determine which services will stay on Azure and which will move to GCP.

- [ ] **Cost Estimation**
  - [ ] Estimate costs for running services on GCP.
  - [ ] Compare with current Azure costs to identify potential savings.

- [ ] **Training**
  - [ ] Train team on GCP services, tools, and best practices.

### Network Hub Setup
- [ ] **Network Hub Project**
  - [ ] Create `network-hub` project.
  - [ ] Set up Shared VPC named `backbone`.
  - [ ] Configure IAM roles and permissions for `network-hub`.

### Environment-Specific Projects

#### QA Environment
- [ ] **Project Setup**
  - [ ] Create `project-qa` (e.g., `tmx-qa`).
